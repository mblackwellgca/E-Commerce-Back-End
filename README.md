## Description
* AS A manager at an internet retail company
    * I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
    * SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

This project is a a back-end for an e-commerce site using Express.js, Sequelize, dotenv, and MySQL. 

## Installation
You’ll need to use the [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package to use environment variables to store sensitive data.

## Criteria
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
* WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
    * THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
* WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
    * THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
* WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
    * THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
* WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
    * THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
* WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
    * THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database


## Usage
